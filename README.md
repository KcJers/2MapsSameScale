1) HTML web page to display 2 maps that can be synchronously zoomed in/out in the same scale/level.
2) Each map can be panned to desirable locations for comparison.
3) Each map can be rotated so that the geographical locations with their shapes can be oriented almost similarly. A "Heading" indicator at top right corner shows the bearing. For Windows PC without touch screen, rotation is done by Alt-Shift dragging the cursor. A "Reset-To-North" button can reset the map to show North poinhting to top.
4) One can share the 2-map web page of their desired locations with the "Share" button to copy its web link (URL).
